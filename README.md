### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sam, and I'm a researcher, analyst, and novice data scientist.

I graduated from Colby College in 2020 with a BA in government. As a student of the social sciences, I fell in love with my methods courses and ventured into the world of mixed methods research, picking up some R skills along the way. My interests in international affairs, good governance, and conflict and stability trends soon blossomed with all sorts of boxplots and regression curves.

Now as a strategic risk analyst, I relish any moment where I can put my Excel skills to the test, and I yearn to develop applicable expertise in automation to make the due diligence/compliance research pipeline more efficient and robust. To achieve this and more, I'm learning Python and have automation and Python for data science in the pipeline.

Stay tuned for upcoming projects that I'll publish on my GitHub. In the meantime, if you want to chat about my projects or wish to collaborate, don't hesitate to reach out at samkanej@gmail.com.
